# USCIS-Status-Checker
A simple java script to check USCIS application status within a range.

This is a small java script to check OPT application status conventiently within a given range. But I only use it to check my case.  

Remember, only use this to check numbers which belong to you or your family or your firm. Otherwise you may get trouble.
